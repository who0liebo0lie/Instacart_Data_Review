📊 Results & Insights
Most common order time was between 10 am and 4 pm.  Most common day to order is Sunday or Monday. Routinely people wait 30 days between reorders. Hypothesize that people who only order groceries once a month are in a higher tax bracket and routine Instacart users. Majority of customers only utilized the service for less than 4 orders. Indication that users took advantage of a special or that the service was not helpful in their lifestyle. Out of the top 20 items ordered, 15 of them are fruit. Certain products like bananas, organic eggs, and milk are reordered at significantly higher rates.Users tend to reorder the same items regularly, making collaborative filtering a viable recommendation strategy.
